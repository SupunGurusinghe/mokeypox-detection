<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>
<p>Monkeypox is a viral disease that can spread through direct skin-to-skin contact, and once infected, one 
of the primary symptoms are painful skin rashes! Monkeypox has been declared as a public health 
emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to the recent increase in the number of cases.
The latest outbreak of monkeypox has now become a source of concern for healthcare professionals 
throughout the world. It is essential to have an early diagnosis in order to slow down its rapid 
progression. Data Science and AI concepts can be used to provide a novel solution for this situation. 
For this purpose, a new skin image-based dataset has been created for the detection of monkeypox 
disease. This dataset consists of five classes: Monkeypox, Melanoma, Acne skin, Normal skin and skin 
cyst, tumour and skin-tags. The provided image classes are collected from internet-based sources and 
clinical data. The dataset is for the purpose of the competition only and is not sufficient for the use of 
clinical diagnosis. </p><br>
<p>During the onset of Monkeypox disease, our aim is to develop an Artificial Intelligence-based disease 
diagnosis model utilizing the image-based dataset provided.</p>
